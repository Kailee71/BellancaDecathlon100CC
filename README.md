# BellancaDecathlon100CC
Data To Mill and Build a 3.26m Wingspan Bellanca Decathlon.

This project was started based on Albert's downloadable data for the Bellanca Decathlon 100cc, and then over time every single part was re-drawn, re-constructed, and re-assembled. This initially took place in Fusion360, but after having done the majority of parts it became clear that a model with this many pieces was not so easily managed in Fusion360. The model tree became to big and cumbersome to use, and scrolling through it simply wasn't any fun any longer. The decision was then made to remodel the whole assembly, again, in Catia, work extensively. Now, no such restrictions were present anymore.

Don't get me wrong - Fusion360 is an _excellent_ CAD system that is almost ideally suited for this kind of project. Catia is just a tiny little bit better at what I need it to do. There are other things that Fusion360 is infinitely better at.

Anyway. This is not a CAD system project, this is a RC Model plane project. The historic base and initial development of this project can be read through here:

[Bauplan Bellanca Super Decathlon](https://www.rc-network.de/threads/bauplan-bellanca-super-decathlon.563351/)

It is in German. If this is an issue, feel free to use Google to translate.

I have started a new thread on the same server to cover issues related to this data here:

[Fr√§sdaten Bellanca Decathlon 100cc](https://www.rc-network.de/threads/XXXXX)

If you intend to build this plane, this should probably be your starting point. Again, it is in German, but I will be more than happy to answer questions in english there also, as I'm sure most of the contributor in the thread will. I do ask that if you do intend to build a plane from this data, if possible also give feedback, either to me directly or better yet into the second thread listed. Let's keep this thing improving - for which I need feedback and suggestions to do stuff. I'm open to almost anything, I'll be happy to provide alternative parts (especially if provided by you, the reader), but make no promises. If I dont like or disagree with a suggestion it may not make it into the dataset. Please don't be upset if this happens.

Please feel free to download any of the data here, and use it to build the plane, browse the parts in the STEP assembly, brew your own new parts, etc. The data is published under the cc-by-nc-sa license which you can read through in the link below. Essentially, it allows any use, _except_ for commercial use.
